### Portfolio 3.0

I really like using the NextJS ecosystem. So, I thought I should just go ahead and adopt it for my portfolio. Don't get me wrong I LOVE RedwoodJS it is just that Redwood is like a 30 ton excavator when you need a Ducati. Both are great, just for different things. Right now I need a slick, quick, & nimble site. Redwood is like Ruby on Rails in JavaScript, which makes it great for heavy hitting sites that need user authentication, offsite databases, & security.

So, anyways here she be my portfolio for the third iteration. Care to check out the code base for the second iteration? (Well here it is)[https://github.com/Isaac-Tait/isaacTaitsPortfolioWebsite]
