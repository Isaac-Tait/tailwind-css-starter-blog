2020 was a rough year, there is no way around it. I don't feel like rehashing it right now. You
could check out my
[other blog to get a full picture](https://macadamgrinding.com/posts/year-of-the-ox/) but suffice it
to say 2020 was a bad bad year. Well every dark hour has its silver lining and 2020 had that too
even if at the time I could not see it. Now looking back though I can see that it jolted me from my
stupor and gave me the kick in the backside I needed to realize where we as Americans were headed.
2020 was the catalyst for me to question the normative idealogies that I had considered gospel truth
for most of my life. I went full vegan (dietary), left the Republican party, divorced myself from
the Evangelical church, started caring about the environment and climate change, and became a
staunch opponent of the 2nd Amendment.

For several years as I walked this path of significant change and admitting that I had been wrong
about so many things I tried to keep it separate from my life as a developer. Then one day while
listening to a podcast by
[The New Evangelicals](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4f1H5198mazEO0YKuMsVz7?si=jZqvbeQhQoy0DziustvU0A)
I realized that I needed to have those uncomfortable conversations. To be real with those around me
about who I was and what I was doing in my life. Hiding who I was because I was afraid to have the
hard conversations with loved one, family, and maybe even potential employers just did not seem
right. So, I rebuilt my portfolio site and tied it into my activism. I am hoping to write regularly
about various topics surrounding veganism, non-violent resistance, Universalism, de-construction,
and whatever else I feel like I should share with the world wide web.
