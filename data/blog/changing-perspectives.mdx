  'What does it mean to be an actual Christ follower? Not the kind you see on the news spewing hate,
  anger, malice, and discontent. You know the ones arguing for more guns, banning drag shows,
  passing anti-LGBTQI+ bills, and displaying a general disregard for the poor, the sick, the tired,
  the hungry... Yea those are not true Christ followers. So, if that is not it - then what is?'

Several years ago, I am a little ashamed to admit - I wish it was longer ago I was solidly on the
Republican bandwagon. I was a right leaning voter who based his voting decisions on a candidates
stance towards banning abortion, protecting the 2nd amendment, and getting rid of socialist policies
such as Obamacare or the Paris Climate Accord. Then in 2020 I became increasingly appalled by my
Republican family and friend's attitudes towards Covid policies meant to protect the vulnerable. I
heard one Republican "Christian" vehemently argue that shutting down the economy was wrong and that
they would rather just let the weak and vulnerable die off and that in a few short months those that
had not died off would be immune and life could go back to normal. I watched as those who claimed to
love their neighbor refused to wear masks and instead become ardent and angry protectors of their
personal "rights" and "freedoms". Aren't Christ followers supposed to die to their selfish and
egotistical desires (Romans 6:6)? I watched in horror as Christians supported the storming of the
Capitol and the attempts to murder duly elected officials.

So, I walked out of the church. I did not say good-bye - I did not look back.

I used to call myself a Calvinist - now I would rather be an atheist than a Calvinist. I used to
espouse Augustinian ideologies - now I am a Pelagianist (is that even a word?).

I recently read two articles that really drove home for me a way to express the feelings I have
inside. This one by
[The Decolonized Christian](https://thedecolonizedchristian.com/guns-militarism-and-the-myth-of-christian-empire/)
and the other an Opinion piece on
[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/opinion/wyoming-republicans-christian-nationalism.html)

I encourage you to read them if you have a moment.

I still consider myself a Christ follower but now I have switched political affiliations and I focus
on what it means to love my neighbor. Jesus said "What you did to the least of these, you did Me." I
want to love my marginalized, mistreated, hated, and down-trodden neighbors. Consequently, I have
decided to focus on three aspects of life that I feel are important:

### Homelessness

### Gun violence

### Food (namely veganism)

So, why those three? Well while homelessness is not nearly as large a problem out here in New
England it is still present. Those people are ignored, mistreated, and marginalized. It is not
right. Gun violence, well to say that I am beyond fed up with those in our nation who would rather
see children killed in schools, malls, or churches rather than give up their guns is an
understatement. Finally, I believe that veganism is the key to healing our planet and giving people
the power to thrive and lead healthy lives. It can free those oppressed by systems that foment harm
and destruction while simultaneously racking their bodies with disease, obesity, and exhaustion.

I can stand on the sidelines and send my thoughts and prayers to all my neighbors in grief, in
poverty, and in fear. Or what if I was put here on this earth to act instead of pray for someone
else to do something?

I spent nearly 30 years of my life afraid to absorb any perspective or faith tradition other than
white evangelicalism. As I have rejected that fear I feel like I have finally stepped into the
light. I learned more from reading a few chapters of the wisdom and practical advice from _His
Holiness the Dalai Lama_ then I did from a life-time of going to church. What else have I missed out
on in my blind acceptance of what I was told was right and what was wrong? Nothing is off the
table - I am questioning everything. It is scary and at the same time it is exhilarating.
