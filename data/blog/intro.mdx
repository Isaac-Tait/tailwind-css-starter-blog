Well here we are - welcome to my newly created NextJS powered portfolio. I hope you enjoy it. I have
a variety of voices on the web. From [cycling](https://macadamgrinding.com),
[angling](https://iloveto.fish), [spirituality](https://eandp.cc), and now this new coding site. So,
poke around for a bit and if you have any questions don't be shy.
