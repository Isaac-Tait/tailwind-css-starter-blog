Today's post is going to be short because I am coming out - getting something off my chest. Back in
2021 my disgust with so called Christians and their actions in regards to COVID-19 and the pandemic
era lock-downs reached a tipping point. So, I wrote an article on Medium under a surname to protect
my true identity. Why did I do post the article under a surname? I guess I was worried that my ideas
were a little to extreme and might offend the evangelical "Christians" in my circle. Recently though
I have come to realize that if I remain silent than I am complicit in the injustice. De-tangling,
deconstructing my faith, and leaving the evangelical church in the past six months was the catalyst
for my coming out today.

The two greatest commandments are to Love God and Love our neighbor. John 14:17 says "If you love me
you will obey my commands". If you do not love your neighbor than you do not love God (because you
are breaking the second greatest commandment). Obedience to those commands hinges entirely on how
you love your neighbor.

[Here is the article I wrote](https://medium.com/@isaac-wesley/a-la-christ-first-response-to-the-pandemic-ce0dddfb630).
I am no longer hiding behind a surname. I will not be complicit with the injustice through my
silence any longer.
